# Gravity with Gravitas: A Solution to the Border Puzzle

The border puzzle was risen in [McCallum(1995)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2118191?casa_token=XLbC-ONAJjYAAAAA%3ANBdsn1X7reV2fZNT6Cq5i8qdtLoShZdfNuSc4mHFycxD_79rCwoyEKL19YLkqHHuAUl0gP-PjGcf0dTVcYiIpVYGc3beeARLxuQBVWVTgrzR_8Xdlqcp&seq=1), which found unexpected large scale of the reduction in trade flows across the Canada-US border. Few years later, [Anderson and van Wincoop](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321455214) did the seminal work on this literature, developing the theoretically founded gravity equation:

$$
x_{ij} = \frac{y_{i}y_{j}}{y^{W}}\left(\frac{t_{ij}}{P_{i}P_{j}}\right)^{1-\sigma}
$$

where $\{P_i\}$ is multilateral resistance variables.
